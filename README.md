##  Business Problem
FruVibe needed to validate its **subscription model and operations** during a pilot in East London.  
The key business questions were:
1. Which products and plans generate the most revenue?  
2. Who are the most valuable customer segments?  
3. How reliable are morning vs. evening deliveries?  
4. What operational bottlenecks exist?

##  Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw order & survey data.  
- Build dashboards for **Sales, Marketing, and Operations**.  
- Translate data into **business recommendations**.  

---

##  Tools & Methods
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** â†’ Data cleaning & processing  
- **Power BI** â†’ Data modeling & dashboards  
- **Excel** â†’ Data validation & quick checks  
- **GitHub** â†’ Version control & portfolio hosting  

---

##  Key Insights
- Subscriptions = **31% of orders but ~70% of revenue** â†’ critical for growth  
- Immunity Booster Platter = **#1 one-time product**  
- Evening deliveries = fewer orders but **higher reliability (96%)**  
- 60% of customers scored **High loyalty** in survey â†’ strong retention potential

##  ðŸ“‚Repository Structure

---

##  Data Preparation
- **Orders dataset**  
   Parsed dates, standardized text  
   Engineered features: `IsSubscription`, `IsEvening`, `IsOnTime`, `Month`, `PrePostPilot`  
- **Survey dataset**  
   Age grouping, loyalty scoring, subscription intent  
- Outputs saved to `data/processed/`:  
   `orders_clean.csv`  
  `survey_clean.csv`  

---

##  DAX Measures (examples)
```DAX
Total Orders = COUNTROWS(orders_clean)
Total Revenue = SUM(orders_clean[Revenue])
OnTime % = DIVIDE([OnTime Orders], [Total Orders])
Fulfillment % = DIVIDE([Fulfilled Orders], [Total Orders])
Subscription % = DIVIDE([Subscription Orders], [Total Orders])
AOV (Morning) = DIVIDE([Revenue (Morning)], [Morning Orders])
AOV (Evening) = DIVIDE([Revenue (Evening)], [Evening Orders])
